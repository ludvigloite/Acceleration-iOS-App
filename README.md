## Acceleration

This game was made in 2018. It is not released to the open market.

# How to play:
Two numbers appear on the screen. Your task is to press the largest number. This gives you a point. You have 30 seconds to press 
the correct number as many times as possible.

# Implementation includes
1. High-score list that is saved permanently on your device. Using *UserDefaults* library.
2. Spesific sound when hitting the correct number. Another sound when hitting wrong number. Also a sound when you get a new high score. Using *AVAudioPlayer* library.
3. A tutorial of the game can at any time be woken.

# What I would like to implement
1. A much prettier UI
2. Sync over GameCenter so that you could compete with your friends.
